Installation
------------

To install the FOX package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ FOX==0.0.1

This will install FOX from the Test PyPI repository. Once installed, you can start using the package in your Python projects.
FOX is a highly **modular** and **flexible** methodology for analyzing and comparing gene-regulatory networks, especially in single-cell gene expression data. It integrates several advanced tools, including **SCENIC**, **NMF**, and **Kendall's Tau**, to provide deep insights into gene regulation. FOX can be used to visualize, compare, and analyze the structure and activity of gene regulatory networks under different conditions.
